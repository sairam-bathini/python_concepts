Writing code can be a fun and logical process! Here's a step-by-step approach to help you think through writing the code for a game like Rock, Paper, Scissors:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Understand the Requirements:

You need a game where a user can play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.
The game should continue until the user decides to stop.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Break Down the Problem:

List the choices: rock, paper, scissors.
Get the user's choice.
Randomly generate the computer's choice.
Compare the choices to determine the winner.
Ask if the user wants to play again.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Plan the Logic:

Use a loop to keep the game running.
Use conditionals to handle invalid inputs and determine the game outcome.
Use a random choice for the computer's selection.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Write the Code:

Import necessary modules.
Define the choices.
Create a loop for the game.
Get user input and validate it.
Generate the computer's choice.
Compare choices and determine the winner.
Ask if the user wants to play again.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here's how you can structure your code:

import random

choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]

print("Welcome to Rock Paper Scissors")

while True:
    user_choice = input("Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): ").lower()
    if user_choice not in choices:
        print("Invalid choice. Try again.")
        continue

    computer_choice = random.choice(choices)
    print(f"Computer chose: {computer_choice}")

    if user_choice == computer_choice:
        print("It's a tie!")
    elif (user_choice == "rock" and computer_choice == "scissors") or \
         (user_choice == "paper" and computer_choice == "rock") or \
         (user_choice == "scissors" and computer_choice == "paper"):
        print("You win!")
    else:
        print("You lose!")

    play_again = input("Do you want to play again? (yes/no): ").lower()
    if play_again != 'yes':
        print("Thanks for playing!")
        break
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test and Debug:
Run your code to see if it works as expected.
Fix any errors or bugs that come up.
By breaking down the problem and planning your logic, you can write clear and effective code. Do you have any specific questions about this process?
